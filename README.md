OnkyoRemote
===========
This is an Android application with a few main goals:
<ol>
<li>My own personal learning</li>
<li>(hopefully) improve on the current Onkyo application offerings (usability, tablet support, etc)</li>
<li>Create a reusable library that includes common functionality:
  <ol>
    <li>Device discovery</li>
    <li>Device control</li>
    <li>Device monitoring (to allow AV receiver to update Application's state</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
